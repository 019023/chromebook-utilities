Click the first bookmark.
Click the second bookmark.
Immediately start spamming the third bookmark.
Reload within one to two seconds of killing the page. Keep spamming whilst doing this!
If you can’t seem to visit the extension page afterwards, you’ve done it right!


If there seems to be an infinity load on any page that the extension page would block, restart your chromebook and try again.

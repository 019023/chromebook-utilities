This is LTMEAT V2 (Easy).

Extension page: chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/manifest.json
Extension settings: chrome://extensions/?id=<extensionidhere>
To get the ID, just go to chrome://extensions/ and find the blocking extension. Click on details and copy the part in the URL after ?id=

Instructions:
1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page lots of times. (About 800 minimum is recommended assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) It is recommended that you add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.
2. Right-click and open all in a new window.
3. Close the window with all those tabs.
4. Open one of the extension pages in the folder now in a new window; you may want to wait more to confirm it worked.
5. If it loads, you did it wrong. If you see a "page unresponsive screen, and a wait/exit page button" you did it right. BUT DO NOT CLICK THE EXIT PAGE BUTTON OR WAIT BUTTON. 
6. Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings and then you've bypassed the patch and the exploit is working.
6. Close everything and you're good to go. With this workaround, LTMEAT can endure a longer life!
